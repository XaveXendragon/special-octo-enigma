Code Hive Alpha

This isn't anything as of yet, possilby a place to store some of my code.

I'm currently working with several microcontrollors:
RedBoard RED-V (SparkFun),
Arduino Uno R3 (Elegoo),
FeatherS2 (Unexpected Maker),
Feather RP2040 (Adafruit),
Raspberry Pi 4 - 4GB,
Raspberry B Rev 2 - 256MB,
Jetson Nano 2GB w/ Wifi dongle (Nvidia).

Most of code I'm uploading will be python3, not related to the microcontrollers.
