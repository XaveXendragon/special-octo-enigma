This is orginal code I created to test my knowledge. I wanted to create a program that created passwords based on a set of rules like; must have upper and lowercase letters along with numbers, and a password length. I wanted to convert all of those character to numbers then convert them back to be verified. I've attempted a few times to cleanup and simplify the code.

I also attempted to create a program that would just randomly guess your password until it found it, but it's SO inefficient.
